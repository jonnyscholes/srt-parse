srt-parse
=========

A module that takes a subtitle (.srt) filename or string containing a srt data that ad-hears to the 
[SubRip](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubRip) spec. That's all this does.

*Note
This package is near identical to the module ``` srt ``` available on npm (which currently has issues in the published 
version and has diverged from my simple needs in the github repo). You can find the github repo for that [here](https://github.com/Colingo/srt-parser).
